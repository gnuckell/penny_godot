## Node that actualizes Penny statements. This stores local data and records based on what the player chooses to do. Most applications will simply use an autoloaded, global host. For more advanced uses, you can instantiate multiple of these simultaneously for concurrent or even network-replicated instances. The records/state can be saved.
